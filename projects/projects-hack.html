                <p class = "project-description">"Re" is a web application that tries to tackle the issue of misinformation around recyclables by 
                    gamifying the experience! Developed with a team of fellow Computer Science students at the Boston University Civic Hacks Hackathon, 
                    I created all of the apps assets and helped design the UI of the application. This project was the first time I had ever contributed 
                    to the development of a web-application, but I learned a lot of skills from my teammates that I would bring with me into future endeavors. </p>

                <p class = "project-description">"Clock In", is a website meant to help students with low self-efficacy in the realm of productivity 
                    not only get started but also remain focused in completing tasks. Built for the Simmons University Shark Hacks Hackathon 2025, I created the skeleton for the website, made the ascending timer 
                    feature, and also debugged pathing issues within the project. In the future, I plan to continue adding features and cleaning up the 
                    files of the project. </p>
