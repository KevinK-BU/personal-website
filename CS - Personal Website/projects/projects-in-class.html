                    and the AI is fully incorporated to have a value known as "lookahead". The lookahead value allows for the AI to make predictions and calculations for their chance of winning and losing using recursive backtracking.</p>

I created a prediction model that predicts placements on the competition show based on the contestants' attributes and past performance. The model uses various machine learning algorithms to make predictions. I also created plots of placement on the basis of contestant attributes and created a presentation analyzing the results.</p>
