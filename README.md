This is my personal website! Built with CSS, HTML, and Javascript, this website showcases my expertise with computer science, my education, and some of my projects that I have worked on while studying computer science. As I learn more within the field of computer science I hope to update this portfolio with new courses and new projects!

I built this website independently to provide a clean, interactive, and accessible space for future collaborators, recruiters and peers to learn about me!
